# What is Cost Monitoring Construct?

Cost Monitoring Construct is a CDK library that helps monitor costs for AWS cloud infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and network traffic. It allows you to set budgets and alerts to ensure that you don't overspend on your cloud resources.

With the Cost Monitoring Construct, you can share the responsibility of cost management between developers and business holders. This is achieved through the creation of meaningful reports that enable the business team to make informed decisions. Additionally, the Construct generates boilerplate code that can be used to apply these decisions in practice, making it easier to stay on top of your budget.

# Why do I need it?

Cloud services can get very expensive, very quickly, especially if you are not careful with your usage. Cost Monitoring Construct helps you to keep an eye on your cloud infrastructure costs so that you can stay within budget. By setting budgets and defining alert strategies, you can take proactive steps to reduce costs before they become a problem.

# How does Cost Monitoring Construct work?

Cost Monitoring Construct uses AWS Tagging practice to track resources related to an specific application, creates proper alert with respect to the defined budget limit and provide overview dashbords. The tool is highly customizable and allows you to customize it to your budgeting strategy based on your specific needs.

Cost Monitoring Construct provides the following features:

- **Cost dashboard:** Displays your current costs and usage, broken down by application's name, region, and etc. Allows you to see how much you are spending on each application and where you might be able to reduce costs.
- **Budgets:** Allows you to set budgets for each applications. It will automatically set up alerts to notify you when your actual costs exceed your budgeted costs. It also continues to track the cost and sending alert if an application continues to cost drastically.
- **Reports:** Provides detailed reports on your application's cloud infrastructure usage and costs, broken down by service, region, and etc. You can use this information to identify areas where you can optimize usage and reduce costs per application.
- **Integration:** Integrates with various tools and monitoring services, such as AWS Cost Explorer and Datadog.
